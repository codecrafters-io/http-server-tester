This is a starting point for Python solutions to the
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, you'll build an HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

Along the way you'll learn about TCP servers,
[HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html),
and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your HTTP server implementation is in `app/main.py`. Study
and uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first stage:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

Time to move on to the next stage!

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `python (3.11)` installed locally
2. Run `./your_server.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.py`.
3. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
